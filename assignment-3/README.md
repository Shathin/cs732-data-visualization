## Running the Project

To run the website locally, the Node Package Manager (npm) must be installed in the system. Post installation, open the terminal inside the directory containing the website code and execute the command `npx http-server ./ --cors`. The site can be accessed at the URL provided by the http-server. 

If one wishes to avoid any hassle with the above process of setting up and running the visualization site locally, the code (and the site) has been setup in CodeSandbox as well. The CodeSandbox version can be accessed here - https://hr7i6.csb.app/. The code can be viewed by the clicking on the ”Open Sandbox” button on the bottom right side of the screen.
